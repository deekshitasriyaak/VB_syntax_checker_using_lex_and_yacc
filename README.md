# VB_syntax_checker_using_lex_and_yacc

Lex and Yacc are helpful tools used in making compilers and understanding text. Lex helps in recognizing patterns in text, like finding words or numbers. It works by changing a bunch of rules into a special kind of computer program. Yacc, on the other hand, helps in figuring out the structure of sentences or commands based on rules. It creates programs that can understand the rules of a language. When used together, Lex and Yacc make it easier to create programs that can read and understand programming languages. They take care of the hard parts of figuring out what different parts of the code mean, so programmers can focus on making their languages work well.

This repository contains Lex and Yacc Python scripts for checking the syntax of Visual Basic code. It provides syntax validation for the following constructs:

- With loop
- For-next loop
- If statement
- Variable declaration
- Constant declaration
- Mkdir statement
